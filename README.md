Simple test using Amazon. Nothing fancy :)

Simple test checking that amazon.co.uk launches ok and items can be searched for and added to basket.

NOTE: You may have to wait roughly 30-40 seconds for the "go to basket" test to be executed as all other tests run quickly prior to that test but the "go to basket" test takes a while for the execution to occur.
